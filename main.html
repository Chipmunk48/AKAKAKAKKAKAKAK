				<p>My lawn now looks fabulous thanks to these big strong men. They did a better job that I could have ever done-Gamesaw Drew ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
				</p>
				<p>I'm not always there when my lawn service is done, but when I am I'm always impressed by the knowledge of my specialist regarding the seasonal weeds in my lawn, what they are doing to eradicate them, and other health issues my lawn might be experiencing, i.e., fungus or brown patches. They are always hustling to service my lawn, but very thorough. I don't see anyone cutting corners. They are always eager to engage me and answer my questions, very friendly, professional and courteous. They are quick to recommend other treatment solutions. I also appreciate the calls in advance to notify me when my specialist will be coming.-Mark  ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ</p>
